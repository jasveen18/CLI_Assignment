    Used `$USER` for current user. 
    Used $HOME for the home directory and $PWD for the current directory.
    
Q2. Takenvinput from the user and handled the case where number can be empty.
    Used for loop for calculating the table of the user input number upto 10.
    
Q3. Taken the input from the user. If value is less than 2 then output number is not prime.
    Used for loop for checking prime condition. Checking n%i==0 and updating flag variable.
    At the end if flag value is 1 then number is not prime else number is prime. 

Q4. Used mkdir for creating directory.
    Used touch for creating file.
    Used standard output approach to add contain of table.sh to file created.
    Used echo and then standard output approach to add "Welcome to Sigmoid" to file created.

Q5. ${#arr[@]} is used to get the length of the arr.
    Max and min are initiazed to the -1000000000 and 1000000000 respectively.
