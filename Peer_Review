AMIT SHUKLA'S REVIEW:
Q1. Used `Date` to show the current date, instead `date +%D` is better option to show only date. 
    Used `Date +%T` for time which is good option according to the question. 
    Used `whoami` for current user. 
    Used $HOME for the home directory and pwd for the current directory.
    
Q2. Taken the input from the user and also handled the case where number can be empty.
    Used while loop for calculating the table of the user input number upto 10.
    The output is also represented in good and correct form.
    
Q3. Taken the input from the user, here empty number case is not handed(altough it was not mentioned in the question).
    Taken the i value equal to 2 and using while loop for checking i<n/2. If true then checking n%i==0 and updating flag variable
    and updating i++. At the end if flag value is 1 then number is not prime else number is prime. Condition for number less than 2 is also maintained.
    Here function has to be build to check if number is prime which is not there.

Q4. Used mkdir for creating directory.
    Used touch for creating file.
    Used standard output approach to add contain of table.sh to file created.
    Used echo and then standard output approach to add "Welcome to Sigmoid" to file created.
    Used ~/Desktop && ls to list the contents on desktop
    
Q5. ${#arr[@]} is used to get the length of the arr.
    Max and min are initiazed to the first element of the array.
    Traversing the loop and checking $i -gt $max for maximum element in the array and $i -lt $min for the minimum element.
    

    
    
    
Kushagra Singh's Review
Q1. Used $(date "+%d/%m/%y") to show the current date, this is also a good option if you date in dd/mm/yy format.
    Used $(date "+%H:%M:%S") for time which is good option according to the question. 
    Used `whoami` for current user. 
    Used $HOME for the home directory and $PWD for the current directory.
    
Q2. Taken the input from the user and also handled the case where number can be empty.

Q3. Taken the input from the user, here empty number case is not handed(altough it was not mentioned in the question).
    If number is less than 1 returned Not a prime number.
    Taken the i value equal to 2 and used for loop where i<=n/2 and hecking n%i==0 
    If false number is not prime else number is prime.
    Here function has to be build to check if number is prime which is not there.

Q4. Used mkdir for creating directory.
    Used touch for creating file.
    Used standard output approach to add contain of table.sh to file created.
    Used echo and then standard output approach to add "Welcome to Sigmoid" to file created.
    Used ls -la /Users/kush/Desktop to list the contents on desktop
    
Q5. ${#arr[@]} is used to get the length of the arr.
    Max and min are initiazed to the first element of the array.
    Traversing the loop and checking $i -gt $max for maximum element in the array and $i -lt $min for the minimum element.
