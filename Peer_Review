AMIT SHUKLA'S REVIEW:
Q1. Used `Date` to show the current date, instead `date +%D` is better option to show only date. 
    Used `Date +%T` for time which is good option according to the question. 
    Used `whoami` for current user. 
    Used $HOME for the home directory and pwd for the current directory.
    
Q2. Taken the input from the user and also handled the case where number can be empty.
    Used while loop for calculating the table of the user input number upto 10.
    The output is also represented in good and correct form.
    
Q3. Taken the input from the user, here empty number case is not handed(altough it was not mentioned in the question).
    Taken the i value equal to 2 and using while loop for checking i<n/2. If true then checking n%i==0 and updating flag variable
    and updating i++. At the end if flag value is 1 then number is not prime else number is prime. Condition for number less than 2 is also maintained.

Q4. Used mkdir for creating directory.
    Used touch for creating file.
    Used standard output approach to add contain of table.sh to file created.
    Used echo and then standard output approach to add "Welcome to Sigmoid" to file created.
    Used ~/Desktop && ls to list the contents on desktop
    
Q5. ${#arr[@]} is used to get the length of the arr.
    Max and min are initiazed to the first element of the array.
    Traversing the loop and checking $i -gt $max for maximum element in the array and $i -lt $min for the minimum element.
    
Expect for the date format in Q1 evertything is according to the question and output is also correct.
